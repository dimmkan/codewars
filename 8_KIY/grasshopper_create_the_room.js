/*
Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. 
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
  room1: {
    name: '1',
    description: '1',
    completed: true,
  },
  room2: {
    name: '2',
    description: '2',
    completed: true,
  },
  room3: {
