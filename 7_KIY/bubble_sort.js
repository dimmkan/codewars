#Bubbleing around

Since everybody hates chaos and loves sorted lists we should implement some more sorting algorithms. Your task is to implement a Bubble sort (for some help look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) and return a list of snapshots after each change of the initial list.

e.g.

If the initial list would be l=[1,2,4,3] my algorithm rotates l[2] and l[3] and after that it adds [1,2,3,4] to the result, which is a list of snapshots.

[1,2,4,3] should return [ [1,2,3,4] ]
[2,1,4,3] should return [ [1,2,4,3], [1,2,3,4] ]
[1,2,3,4] should return []

function bubble(arr) {
    const res = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < (arr.length - i - 1); j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                const temp = arr[j]
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
                arr[j + 1] = temp
                res.push(arr.slice());
            }
        }
    }

    return res;
